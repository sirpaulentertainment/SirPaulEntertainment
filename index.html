    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I’m SirPaul, a video–first creator obsessed with rhythm, emotion, and detail. I don’t just make content — I shape moments into stories people remember.</p>
    <p>Over the last few years I’ve edited for brands, creators, and startups that care about how they show up online. From quick-fire UGC to cinematic cuts, I focus on three things: <strong>clarity, emotion, and conversion.</strong></p>
    <p>I understand both sides of the game: the creative that stops the scroll, and the strategy that keeps people watching. Every frame has a job. Every cut has a reason.</p>
    <p>If you’re looking for someone who simply follows instructions, I’m not your guy. If you want someone who treats your idea like their own and thinks in hooks, pacing, and outcomes — that’s where I come in.</p>

    <h1>Content Creator</h1>
    <p>I create content that feels human, not manufactured. From vertical short-form videos to full campaign series, I help you develop concepts, shape hooks, and tell stories that fit your voice and audience.</p>
    <p>I work with personal brands, creators, and startups that want a consistent, cinematic feel — content that looks good, sounds clear, and moves people to action.</p>

    <h1>Video Editor</h1>
    <p>Clean cuts. Precise pacing. Story at the center. I specialise in editing UGC, TikTok/Reels, brand ads, cinematic pieces, and product videos that keep viewers watching and make the message unforgettable.</p>
    <p>From rough footage to final export, I handle cuts, pacing, sound design, basic VFX, color mood, and final polish. You bring the vision — I turn it into something people want to watch again.</p>

    <h1>Social Media Manager</h1>
    <p>I don’t just post content — I manage how your presence feels and performs. From planning and calendars to consistency and review, I help your content and strategy work together.</p>
    <p>I support personal brands and businesses that want a structured, intentional online presence with content aligned to clear goals instead of random trends.</p>
